Complete rewrite of [[https://github.com/18fadly-anthony/backr-py][backr-py]], now with [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_encoding][delta compression]]

* Features
  - Delta compression: backups only make copies of files that have changed since the last one
  - Garbage Collection: old backups can be deleted without affecting new ones
  - Backups can stored in different locations
